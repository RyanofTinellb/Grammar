# Tinellbian Languages
A website devoted to the languages constructed for the fictional universe Tinellb.

Tolkien called it his &lsquo;secret vice&rsquo;. Trekkies and Esperantists both have languages made for them. But the twenty-first century has seen an explosion of creative works utilising constructed languages (&lsquo;conlangs&rsquo;). Conlangery has come out of the shadows with Paul Frommer&rsquo;s Na&rsquo;vi (for James Cameron&rsquo;s *Avatar*) and David Peterson&rsquo;s Dothraki and High Valyrian (spoken in *Game of Thrones*).

This site details my little contribution to this expanding roster, with the Tinellbian languages as spoken by characters in [The Coelacanth Quartet](http://thecoelacanthquartet.tinellb.com).
