<main><h1>High Lulani</h1>
<p>High Lulani is the language created by Loren, queen of the Ptokonoi. It features a semi-closed verb class and extensive compounding. It has a featural script.</p>
<p>I once had the beginnings of what was to be the Ptokan language, and the language of the Fezhlê. The latter was once designed as a daughter language of Ptokan, but it had some features, mostly phonological, that seemed to come from an earlier language. Thus was Lulani born. Originally intended to be a phonology sketch, Lulani has expanded greatly into a language in its own right. So much so, in fact, that Ptokan and Fezhlê have been forced to change somewhat to adapt.</p>
